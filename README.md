<h2>Testing</h2>
<h4>CoreBenchmark results </h4>

| CPU  | Score|
|------|--------|
| AMD Ryzen 3 3200G | 940 |
| Intel Core i7-7600U 2.80 GHz | 800 |
| Intel Core i5-7Y54 1.20 Ghz | 600 |

Single core benchmark
-----
~~~python
from core_benchmark import CoreBenchmark

# Create CoreBenchmark object
bench = CoreBenchmark()

# Print the current cpu score
# on single core benchmark
print(bench.benchmark())


~~~

Multi-core benchmark
-----
~~~python
from core_benchmark import CoreBenchmark

# Create CoreBenchmark object
bench = CoreBenchmark()

# Print the current cpu score
# on Multi-core benchmark
print(bench.benchmark_all_cores())
